Can play/pause and advance to next track by shorting input pins to GND, but no way to select particular tracks. Onboard 2W amp. Can be used for ambient BGM.  |  |

Can select particular tracks/folders (by number only not by name), start/stop etc. No on-board amp. https://arduinoplusplus.wordpress.com/2018/07/23/yx5300-serial-mp3-player-catalex-module/ | https://www.amazon.co.uk/YX5300-Control-Serial-Player-Arduino/dp/B01JCI23JG |

Typically combines YX5200 chip as above with YX8002-8S 3W amp. Try to avoid boards that come with MH2024K-24SS / JC AA20HF J616-94 clones, which although offer similar funcitonality many people have reported are fiddly to get to work - see https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/ViewTopic.php?TID=11977&P=1#164307 for a description of differences |  |

Can playback and mix multiple simultaneous audio files. SPI interface, requires library and Arduino controller. | https://www.banggood.com/VS1053-VS1053B-MP3-Module-Development-Board-UNO-Board-with-SD-Card-Slot-Ogg-Real-time-Recording-p-1609634.html    https://www.banggood.com/VS1053-Audio-MP3-Player-Module-Audio-Decoder-Board-Development-Board-Onboard-Recording-Function-with-Amplifier-SPI-p-1754987.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN  (no SD card)  |
