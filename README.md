Can play/pause and advance to next track by shorting input pins to GND, but no way to select particular tracks. Onboard 2W amp. Can be used for ambient BGM.  | https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32859062476.html |

Can select particular tracks/folders (by number only not by name), start/stop etc. No on-board amp. https://arduinoplusplus.wordpress.com/2018/07/23/yx5300-serial-mp3-player-catalex-module/ | https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GmKYafRk4t |
| ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playfultechnology/arduino-audio/main/Docs/dfplayer.png) | YX5200 / YX5300  | Serial / IO / ADKey | Goes by many names - most commonly "DFPlayer Mini", but also "MP3-TF-16P" and others. Typically combines YX5200 chip as above with YX8002-8S 3W amp. Try to avoid boards that come with MH2024K-24SS / JC AA20HF J616-94 clones, which although offer similar funcitonality many people have reported are fiddly to get to work - see https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/ViewTopic.php?TID=11977&P=1#164307 for a description of differences | https://www.banggood.com/custlink/GKDyjTR24w |

Can playback and mix multiple simultaneous audio files. SPI interface, requires library and Arduino controller. | https://www.banggood.com/custlink/mGDEo7yMso (Breakout with SD)    https://www.banggood.com/custlink/KDKRowRznd  (Breakout *no* SD card) https://www.banggood.com/custlink/vmvyl1RMA0 (Shield for UNO with SD card |
